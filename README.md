# Cipher-Project
 Various ciphers are shown allowing for encryption and decryption of messages.
 ## Ciphers Included
 There are currently 4 separate ciphers included in the project. There are 5 separate options, however this is because there is one option for a ceasar cipher. This cipher is just a certain implementation of the shift cipher.
 ### Shift Cipher
 This cipher just takes in a message a key and then shifts all of the letters by that key.
 ```
 E_n(x) = (x + n) mod 26
 D_n(x) = (x - n) mod 26
 ```
